# Welcome to your CDK JavaScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with JavaScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app. The build step is not required when using JavaScript.

## Useful commands

* `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy -c stage={ENV} -c seq={SEQ} -c instance-id={CONNECT-INSTANCE-ID} -c data-stream={STREAM-NAME}`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
